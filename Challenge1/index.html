    <h1>Coding Challenge 1 in JavaScript!</h1>
    <p><br>Samane and a friend invented a simple game where the player with the highest value of her height (in centimeters) plus five times his age wins (what a silly game:)) <br><br> 1. Create variables for the heights and ages of two friends and assign them some values <br><br> 2. Calculate their scores <br><br> 3.Decide who wins and print the winner to the console. Include the Score in the string that you output to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw (both players with the same score). <br><br> 4. EXTRA: Add a third player and now decide who wins. Hint: You will need the && operator to take the decision.</p>
