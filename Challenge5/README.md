## Change [Pig Game](https://github.com/SamaneYaghoobi/Pig-Game) to follow this rule:

Add another dice to the game, so that there are two dices now. The player looses his current score when one of them is a 1. (Hint: you will need CSS to position the second dice, so take a look at the CSS code for the first one.)
