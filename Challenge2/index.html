    <h1>Coding Challenge 2 in JavaScript!</h1>
    <p><br>1. Create an array with some years where persons were born<br><br>2. Create an empty array (just [])<br><br>3. Use a loop to fill the array with the ages of the persons<br><br>4. Use another loop to log into the console whether each person is of full age (18 or older), as well as their age<br><br>5. Finally, create a function called printFullAge which receives the vector of years as an argument, executes the steps 2, 3, 4 and returns a vector of true/false boolean values: true if the person is of full age (>= 18 years) and false if not (
        < 18 years)<br><br>6. Call the function with two different vectors and store the results in two variables: full_1 and full_2<br><br>Example input: [1965, 2008, 1992]<br>Example output: [true, false, true]<br><br>Hint: You can use a loop not only to read from an array, like y[i], but also to set values in an array, like y[i] = ... You can also use the specific array methods.</p>
