    <h1>Coding Challenge 6 in JavaScript!</h1>
    <h4>Let's build a fun quiz game in the console!</h4>

    <p><br>1. Build a function constructor called Question to describe a question. A question should include:<br> a) question itself<br> b) the answers from which the player can choose the correct one (choose an adequate data structure here, array, object, etc.)<br> c) correct answer (I would use a number for this)<br><br> 2. Create a couple of questions using the constructor<br><br> 3. Store them all inside an array<br><br> 4. Select one random question and log it on the console, together with the possible answers (each question should have a number) (Hint: write a method for the Question objects for this task).<br><br> 5. Use the 'prompt' function to ask the user for the correct answer. The user should input the number of the correct answer such as you displayed it on Task 4.<br><br> 6. Check if the answer is correct and print to the console whether the answer is correct ot nor (Hint: write another method for this).<br><br> 7. Suppose this code would be a plugin for other programmers to use in their code. So make sure that all your code is private and doesn't interfere with the other programmers code (Hint: we learned a special technique to do exactly that). </p>
